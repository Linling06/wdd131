        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            SpaceExplorer will provide an inviting introduction to astronomy for curious
            beginners. The site’s purpose is to explain basic astronomical
            concepts, showcase our solar system and other celestial objects,
            and encourage visitors to explore the universe through engaging
            narratives and interactive images.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The primary audience is anyone with an interest in space who is new
            to astronomy. This includes students, families, hobbyists and casual
            visitors seeking clear, accessible explanations and inspiring images
            without needing prior scientific knowledge. The site is designed
            to be approachable for all ages and backgrounds.
        </p>

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript will be used to add several interactive features. A
            gallery of planets and celestial objects will be generated from
            an array of objects. Each thumbnail will open a modal window
            displaying a higher–resolution image and caption; the modal can be
            closed by clicking the close button, clicking outside the image,
            or pressing the Esc key. Visitors can toggle between dark and
            light modes to suit their preference, and a mobile navigation
            menu will open and close in response to taps on a menu icon.
            These elements will be organized into modular functions, use
            event listeners for user actions, and include conditional
            branching to decide when to show or hide content.

        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
        <nav>
            <a href="#">Home</a>
            <a href="#">Gallery</a>
        </nav>
        <hr />

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
            The home page will welcome visitors with a large hero image of the night
            sky or a galaxy, accompanied by the site logo and a navigation
            menu. Following the hero section, brief paragraphs will explain
            what astronomy is, why exploring the universe matters and what
            content the visitor will find on the site. Images will be used to
            illustrate planets, stars and galaxies. The home page will also
            include links to the gallery page and will invite users to
            explore further.
        </p>
        <h3>Gallery page</h3>
        <p>
            The gallery page will display a grid of planet and celestial
            photographs. Each thumbnail will be created from an array of
            objects and will open a larger
            image in a modal when clicked. Captions will provide the
            name of each planet and a short fact. Additional information
            such as a link back to the home page or further reading will be
            provided in the footer.
        </p>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
            Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
            here
        </p>

        <h3>Home</h3>
        <p>
            The home wireframe shows a header with the SpaceExplorer logo and
            navigation links. Below the header is a large hero image area to
            captivate the visitor. Headings and text sections provide
            introductory information about astronomy and link to the gallery.
            A footer provides credits and additional navigation.
        </p>
        <img src="images/home-wireframe.jpg" alt="Home page wireframe" />

        <h3>Gallery page</h3>
        <p>
            The gallery wireframe lays out a header with the logo and
            navigation, followed by a responsive grid of nine square
            thumbnails representing planets. The layout adapts to different screen sizes.
